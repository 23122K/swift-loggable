# Loggable
---
Swift macro that eliminates boilerplate when it comes to logging functions. Allows for function logging in any Class, Actor, Struct, or Enum and supports per-function logging while letting you ignore specific functions. The macro handles static, throwing, async, and generic functions with standard arguments as well as inout arguments, closures, and `@autoclosures`. Furthermore, it doesnâ€™t tie you to any underlying logging mechanism, so you can easily implement your own logic.

---
#### Motivation 
Just like any other macro, my main motivation was to eliminate the boilerplate involved in logging functions, especially those found in legacy modules, crafted by ancient programmers in a singelton pattern. Additionally, I didnâ€™t want to restrict anyone to logging mechanism of my choice so `Loggable` has been designed to allow you to implement the logging mechanism that best suits your project, whether itâ€™s Sentry, swift-log, or any other logging library.

---
#### Usage
There are three macros: `@Logged`, `@Log`, and `@Omit`. Both `@Logged` and `@Log` let you specify a class that inherits from `Loggable` to provide your own implementation, while `@Omit` is used to disable logging for that function.

`@Logged` can be attach to, for example, a class. When applied, it automatically annotates every function inside that class with `@Log`. The `@Logged` macro also lets you specify which underlying logging logic should be invoked when a function is called. By default, it uses the `default` parameter, which utilizes `os_log` for logging. You can override this behavior by inheriting from the `Loggable` class and providing a custom argument to the `@Logged` macro, for example:
```swift
@Logged(using: .custom)
```
Where `.custom` in this example would be a an extension to `Loggable` class.

Providing a custom argument to `@Logged` automatically propagates it to every function within its scope. If you want to exclude a specific function from logging, simply annotate it with `@Omit`. Contrarily, if you need a different logging mechanism for a function within that scope or just want to log a single function, you can annotate that function with `@Log` which also allows you to specify your desired logging mechanism.

As of now, there are three methods for you to override:
```swift
open func log(at location: String, of declaration: String)
```
This method is invoked when the function neither returns a value nor throws an error.

```swift
open func log(at location: String, of declaration: String, error: any Error)
```
When a function is marked with the `throw` keyword, regardless of whether it returns a value or not, this method will be called.

```swift
open func log(at location: String, of declaration: String, result: Any)
```
Finally, when a function specifies a return value, this method is invoked.

---
#### Examples
Logging is a simple as annoting type with `@Logged`, it will automaically add `@Log` annotation to every function inside.
```swift
@Logged
struct Foo { 
  // ...
}
```
If you donâ€™t want to log a function that is located in a scope annotated with @Logged, mark it with @Omit like shown below, it will be ignored when the macro is expanded.
```swift
@Logged
struct Foo { 
  func bar() { 
    // ...
  }

  @Omit
  func baz() {
    // ... 
  }
}
```
When you have a standalone function or wish to log only specific functions, use the @Log macro, e.g.:
```swift
extension Foo {
  @Log
  static func bar() { 
    // ...
  }
}
```
To implement a custom logging mechanism, start by inheriting from the Loggable class and providing your implementation.
```swift
class Custom: Loggable, @unchecked Sendable {
  override func log(at location: String, of declaration: String) {
    // Handle 
  }
  
  override func log(at location: String, of declaration: String, error: any Error) {
    // Handle
  }
  
  override func log(at location: String, of declaration: String, result: Any) {
    // Handle
  }
}
```
Then, to utilize a nicer syntax, create an extension to Loggable:
```swift
extension Loggable {
  static let custom: Loggable = Custom()
}
```
> :warning: Please note that `custom` is implicitly specified as `Loggable`. Without this implicit specification, using `@Logged(using: .custom)` would trigger a compiler error, even though it works fine with `@Log(using: .custom)`. Iâ€™m not yet sure why this is happening, but I will try to address that.

After that, you are ready to go. Simply, as mentioned above, annotate the desired class, struct, or function and pass `custom` implementation as a parameter, e.g.:
```swift
@Logged(using: .custom)
struct Foo {
  func someVoidFunction() {
    // ...
  }

  func someThrowingFunction() throws -> String {
    // ...
  }
}
```
If you ever need to use a different logger within a type annotated with @Logged, just annotate the specific function with @Log and supply a different argument.
```swift
@Logged(using: .custom)
struct Foo {
  // ...

  @Log(using: .different)
  func someSpecialFunction() async throws {
    // ...
  }
}
```

#### Future directions 
Iâ€™m not entirely sure that using `Loggable` as a class is the best solution, but it does allow for a nicer syntax like `@Log(using: .custom)`, rather than requiring you to specify an implicit type as you would with a protocol. Additionally, although Iâ€™m not completely sure how solid this approach is, the default implementation can be overridden or more precisely, shadowed:
```swift
extension Loggable {
Â  static let `default` = Custom()
}
```
This approach allows us to swap the default logic used by `@Log` and `@Logged` without needing to pass a parameter - in this case we don't need to implicitly specify `Loggable` as a type. Additionally, Iâ€™d like to add logging for the parameters passed to a function. However, I foresee potential issues - such as when a closure is passed, which would need to be computed first. If you have any suggestions, please let me know ðŸ˜‰
